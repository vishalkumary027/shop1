It also serves retailers by providing a platform to reach a broader audience.

1.3 Scope of Project
The scope of the project includes:

User registration and authentication
Product catalog management
Shopping cart functionality
Order processing and payment integration
Customer reviews and ratings
Admin panel for product and user management
2. Analysis
2.1 System Analysis
2.1.1 Existing System
Current online shopping systems often lack integration between inventory management and the shopping experience, leading to issues such as stock mismanagement and a poor user interface.

2.1.2 Proposed System
The proposed system addresses these issues by integrating inventory management with the user interface, ensuring that stock levels are accurately reflected in real-time and providing an intuitive shopping experience.

2.2 System Specific Requirements
User-friendly interface
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
Secure payment gateway integration
Database for product, user, and order management
3. Feasibility Study

4. Design Approach
4.1 Introduction to Design
The design phase focuses on creating a user-centric interface and ensuring that the backend architecture is robust and scalable.

4.2 E-R Diagrams
Entity-Relationship diagrams illustrate the data structure and relationships between different entities in the system, such as users, products, and orders.

4.3 UML Diagrams
4.3.1 Use Case Diagrams
Use case diagrams define the interactions between users (customers and administrators) and the system, outlining functionalities such as registration, product search, and order processing.

4.3.2 Sequence Diagram
Sequence diagrams demonstrate the order of operations for critical processes like user login, product purchase, and order confirmation.

4.3.3 Class Diagram
Class diagrams depict the structure of the system by illustrating the classes, their attributes, and methods.

4.3.4 State Chart Diagram
State chart diagrams show the various states of an order (e.g., pending, completed, canceled) and transitions based on user actions.

4.4 Data Flow Diagrams
Data flow diagrams illustrate how data moves through the system, highlighting processes like user registration, product management, and payment processing.

5. Project Modules
The shopping portal consists of several modules, including:

User Management
Product Management
Order Management
Payment Processing
Review and Rating System
Admin Dashboard
6. Database Tables
The database design includes tables for:

Users (user_id, username, password, email, etc.)
Products (product_id, name, description, price, stock_quantity, etc.)
Orders (order_id, user_id, total_amount, order_date, etc.)
Order_Items (order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, etc.)
Reviews (review_id, user_id, product_id, rating, comment, etc.)
7. Implementation
7.1 Concepts And Techniques
Implementation utilizes web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Techniques include responsive design, AJAX for asynchronous operations, and secure coding practices.

7.2 Testing
The testing phase includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure all functionalities work as intended.

7.3 Test Cases
